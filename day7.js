//Question 19: Dinner Guests: Use one of your programs from Exercises 14 through 18 to print a message indicating the number of people you are inviting to dinner.
//Explain & TIP: Arrays have a length property that tells you how many items are in the list. Use this to inform your guests how big the party will be
//let guests: string[] = ["Huzaifa", "Haseeb", "Shariq", "Abdullah", "Muhib" , "Usman"];
//console.log(`I am inviting ${guests.length} people to dinner.`);
//                                                                    TASK NO 2
//Question 20: Think of something you could store in an array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.
//Explain & TIP: Arrays are perfect for keeping a collection of similar items. Choose a theme you like and list several examples
//let cities :string[] =["Karach","Hyderabad","Islamabad","lahore"]
//console.log("Cities i would like to visit" ,cities);
//                                                                     TASK NO 3
//Question 21: Think of something you could store in a TypeScript Object. Write a program that creates Objects containing these items.
//Explain & TIP: Objects in TypeScript can store various related data about a single entity. Think of an object as a container for characteristics of something, like a book or a car
var book = {
    bookname: "Atomic Habit",
    Author: "James Clear",
    Releasedate: 2018
};
console.log("book information : ".concat(book.bookname, ", book Author : ").concat(book.Author, " , Book release date : ").concat(book.Releasedate));
